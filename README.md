#Regex Demo

This project is a demonstration of how regular expressions are being used (Regular expressions are shortened as Regex).

Regex is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern in text.
Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation.

##Validations

It contains a method which validates a given Firstname, MobileNumber, Email, Password and an ID to return true or false if it was inputed in the format
defined in the code in kine with the business-specification..
